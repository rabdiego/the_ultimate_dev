# the ultimate dev project ðŸ‘¿
> by rabdiego

created this to gain some experience with Docker, SQL, and web applications in general. not that I want to become a webdeveloper, but I need to understand the basics to work with MLOps.

## what this amazing and cutting-edge project does??

nothing special, just an **ugly** front-end to retrieve data from a database. and maybe put some data into the db also idk

## is this a joke?

prolly
